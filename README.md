# sentimentAnalysisBayes

In this repo I will create a simple sentiment analysis tool based on a bag of words and Naive Bayes approach.

Basically, i will assign a positive and a negative score to each word (or token if you wish) and I will calculate conditional probabilities.

The main idea is that i want to calculate P(positive|"Specific text with positive or negative sentiment") values
